# Style Transfer Neural Networks

## Background Research

Here is a link to a bunch of the data used in the network. We could potentially
pull out all of the art based datasets and use those to train our own network.

Here is an example notebook using the pretrained VGG model and tensorflow

Somehow I am not totally understanding how these loss functions are working and
how by running the net you end up with some sort of transformation that just
works.
